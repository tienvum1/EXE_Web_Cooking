          'Begin by seasoning the steak generously with salt and black pepper on both sides. This enhances the flavor and ensures a well-balanced taste. Next, heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat until it starts to shimmer. Carefully place the steak in the pan and sear it for about 2-3 minutes per side if you prefer it medium-rare. Once done, remove the steak from the pan and let it rest on a cutting board for 5 minutes before slicing thinly against the grain.',
